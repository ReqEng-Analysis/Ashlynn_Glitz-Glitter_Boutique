  The business enviornment is primarily online, more specifically e-commerce. However, they often provide occasional in-person sales and participate in vendor events. Because of the specified enviornmental factors, there are other competing business who offer the same services. A potential influence to the business and system is the idea that there are other businesses that may have better services and systems that would entice customers to buying from a competitor. Another aspect of the business to consider is the overall cost of creating the products and the offered price. Since most of the company's revenue is from tumblers and their variations, we must take into the consideration the cost of the product itself prior to being customized.
